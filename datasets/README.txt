Main dataset: coding_workers.csv

Supplementary datasets are all the different versions of the main dataset, with additional rows created by
splitting multiple values in a selected column of the main dataset (e.g. for PastJobTitleSelect_df.csv dataset the multiple values in the column PastJobTitleSelect were split into new rows).
